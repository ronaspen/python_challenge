I aplogize in advance for the quality of work. With this course, I am coming back to intensive study after many years, and got a bit anxious and psyched-out with the last 2 challenges. I just couldn't think clearly.
I am going to change my study habits and look at each challenge at least a week in advance, giving myself enough time to tailor my knowledge for them. I only gave myself a day or 2 this and last week, because I was rewatching all the lectures. I realized this is the wrong way to do it.
I will also sign up for a tutor to go over this assignment again.
