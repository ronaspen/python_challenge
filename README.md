I aplogize in advance for the quality of work. With this course, I am coming back to intensive study after many years, and got a bit anxious and psyched-out with the assignments. I just couldn't think clearly.
I am going to change my study habits and look at each challenge at least a week in advance, giving myself enough time to tailor my knowledge for them.
I will also sign up for a tutor to go over this assignment again.
